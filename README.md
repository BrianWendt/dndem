## About the Project
From [Brian Wendt](https://www.linkedin.com/in/brianwendtarizona/ "Brian Wendt"):
> I'm working on DnDEM as a way of learning the React.js framework while also building a helpful tool for myself and other DMs out there. Coding and Dungeons and Dragons are two of my biggest passions.
>
> Please feel welcome to send me feedback and feature requests. With some continued attention, I believe this project could grow into a goto tool for DMs wanting a clean, simple to use utility.
